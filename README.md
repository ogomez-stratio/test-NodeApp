## Calling services from main project

- For example getAllClinics service:

```javascript
import seneca from 'seneca';
import senecaPromise from 'seneca-as-promised';

const senecaContext = seneca({ log: 'silent' })
                     .client({ host: 'localhost', port: 9003 })
                     .use(senecaPromise);

const getAllClinicsPattern = { service: 'clinics', command: 'getAllClinics'};

senecaContext.actAsync(Object.assign({}, getAllClinicsPattern))
             .then(response => console.log(response.result));
```
* Considerations:
  - Import or require seneca and seneca-as-promised libraries. The second one is used to make seneca promises ready.
  - Build a seneca context client setting seneca-as-promised.
  - Define the pattern of the service you want to call to. In this case, we are using the clinics service (we have to set the string treatments in the service property) and de command getAllClinics.
  - Make the request to the microservice using the method actAsync from the senecaContext previously created.
  - When the promise resolves the returned object can be found in result property of the returned response.

## Calling services from external tools
* Seneca is a wrapper of a node.js server making easier the development of a microservice. So, you can still call the services without using a seneca client in a parent project.
* For example, it is possible calling the microservice using postman or the curl command as follows (assuming the service is running in localhost and listening to port 10101):

`curl â€“d '{"service" : "clinics", "command": "getAllClinics"}' http://localhost:9003/act`
